          <p>
            A time zone is a region of the Earth that has the same standard time. The concept was developed to allow for a uniform timekeeping system that aligns with the rotation of the Earth relative to the Sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Earth is divided into 24 time zones, each approximately 15 degrees of longitude apart. This division corresponds to the Earth's rotation, which takes about 24 hours to complete. Each time zone typically differs by one hour from its neighboring zones.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">History of Time Zones</h2>
          <p>
            The need for standardized time arose in the 19th century, particularly with the expansion of railroads and telegraph systems. Before time zones were established, local mean time was used, causing confusion during travel and communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1884, an international conference in Washington D.C. established the system of time zones we use today. The conference created the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) standard, which defined time zones based on their offset from GMT.

        <section className="mb-6">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">How Time Zones Work</h2>
          <p>
            Time zones are usually expressed as an offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, UTC+0 is the same as GMT, while UTC-5 represents a time zone that is 5 hours behind UTC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some regions observe Daylight Saving Time (DST), which adjusts the clock forward by one hour during warmer months. This practice aims to make better use of daylight and conserve energy.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">The Importance of Time Zones</h2>
          <p>
            Time zones are crucial for scheduling events, travel, and business operations across different regions. Understanding time zones helps avoid confusion and ensures that activities are coordinated effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if a meeting is scheduled at 10 AM EST, participants in PST need to be aware that it will take place at 7 AM in their local time. Misunderstandings about time zones can lead to missed appointments and logistical issues.
